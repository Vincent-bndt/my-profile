               <p> Sport is my <strong>passion</strong> wether it be basketball, running or tennis. I like hang out  with my friends and share lots of memories with them. I think it's the greatest gift we have. I can escape from reality and hang out without bothering my mind with work, deadlines...🥳 </p>

               <p>I dreamed of being a professional basketball player, but you know, the famous injury... We manage, with our team, to won the departemental Lyon championship in 2019! My favorite team is the <em>LA Clippers</em> not only because of DeAndre Jordan!. I think they play with a great mindset and fairness when others are brutal. </p>

               <p>Ever since I went to New York 🇺🇸, Mauritius 🇲🇺, Grece 🇬🇷, Bali 🇮🇩 and Tahiti 🇵🇫 I knew it would be a one of a kind <strong>experience</strong> 💥.
